Read From/Write To Syntax:

Redirect output - use ::file.txt

e.g., 

    ls ::file.txt   [equivalent to ls > file.txt]

Redirecting input - use file.txt::

e.g., suppose file1.txt contains path to some working directory:

    ls file1.txt::   [equivalent to ls < file1.txt]

Combining both:

    xargs ls file1.txt:: ::file2.txt  [equivalent to xargs ls < file1.txt > file2.txt]

    (list of contents of directory in file1 are written to file2.txt)
